# VR-Con-Booth
Standardized dealer's den booth for virtual reality fur cons.  

## What is this?
This is a collection of assets and files that make adding a dealer's den to a virtual furry con easier and faster.  The hope of this project is to make something that is reusable for artists between cons and something that a convention can easially integrate into any VR world.  The dimensions were picked to be look good in VRchat, NEOS, second life, and minecraft so an artist can provide just one set of images and a con or world maker can reuse them anywhere.  
If you're an artist check out the artist resources for the template image and examples, as well as an online booth previewer.
If you're a convention, the con resources folder has objects and a unity prefab for drag and drop adding to your world.
