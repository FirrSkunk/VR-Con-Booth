In this folder are the models that I've made or have been controbuted to this project. It should be as simple as download and change out the example texture.  IF you have any problems let me know!!

If you'd like to submit a booth, either send a pull request, or reach out to me on twitter or telegram and I can add it in here.  Just be sure to embed the template texture for the booth assets
to make it easier on the end user.  And if you can send a preview image along with it.  <3
