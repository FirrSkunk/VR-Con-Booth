### What is this?

Virtual furry conventions have been a real mixed experience for artists and dealers. Some coventions spend very little time and effort on them, with at most a list of links to various store pages.  Some coventions have gone all out, creating gigantic virtual reality worlds with large custom spaces for artists and dealers to decorate any way they'd like.  Both of these options can create headaches for an artist that's trying to promote themselves, especially for someone that doesn't have much experieice in 3d modeling or virtual spaces.  
The idea behind the assets in this git is meant to be a "starting point" for both virtual conventions that have a VR space and for artists that want to join in.  My hope is that this is something that is both easy to implement with no real need to learn anything new, but also have soemthing that could be customized by an experienced user into something cool.
The reason for making this into something that resembles a real life dealer's den booth is that it should be something that is approachable for any artist or dealer.  While going into something that can't exist IRL is nice and totally fine, its a lot easier for an artist to build something if they have a frame of reference.  

### How to use
For convention staff, there are both ready made dealer's booth models and a unity package that has everything needed to start to integrate a dealer's den into your world.  They're perfect for VRchat and Neos.  They're low poly count, only two materials, and can be easially customized to fit in wihth any theme.  You can also split them out so that the back banner ads could be placed in other areas, for things such as wall signs or rotating advertisments in your world.  If you're building this into a VRchat world all you need to do is drag and drop the prefab into the world then drag the artist's image onto it.

If you're an artist, all you need to do is download the template image and design your adverts into that format.  Provide that to the convention or dealer's den owner and you're good to go.  Of course, if you understand a little more about unity or 3d modeling you can do some really fancy stuff such as adding a normal map on the top of the booth to make it seem like you have objects on top or even using a defferent shader to make it seem like your table extends beyond reality. 




### To do
This is stuff I want to implelemt

- Make a web based "preview page" so an artist can upload the image they're working on and get a preview of what it would look like in the world without having to upload anything.  borrow most stuff from here: https://github.com/greggman/getuserimage-unity-webgl  
- Make a substance painter project for those more technically inclined.
- Release the "fancy shader" that allows the cool fake 3d effect I used for BRFF.
