### What is this?

This git is a collection of assets and tools for both artists and conventions to make a standardized convention "booth" for dealer's dens.  This lets artists reuse assets from convetnion to convention and allows conventions to focus more on the rest of the dealer's den instead of manually inporting artist assets.  

## Check it out
In the main github page [here](https://github.com/FirrSkunk/VR-Con-Booth/tree/main/Dealer%20resources) there's an example PSD and PNG file with the dimensions for an artist to make their booth file from.  Download that, make your image, and save it as a PNG.  

To test your image and see what it looks like on an example page, you can use [this page](/example/index.html) to check it out on a virtual model.  Have fun!

### To do
This is stuff I want to implelemt

- Make a substance painter project for those more technically inclined.
- Release the "fancy shader" that allows the cool fake 3d effect I used for BRFF.


### Why make this

Virtual furry conventions have been a real mixed experience for artists and dealers. Some coventions spend very little time and effort on them, with at most a list of links to various store pages.  Some coventions have gone all out, creating gigantic virtual reality worlds with large custom spaces for artists and dealers to decorate any way they'd like.  Both of these options can create headaches for an artist that's trying to promote themselves, especially for someone that doesn't have much experieice in 3d modeling or virtual spaces.  
The idea behind the assets in this git is meant to be a "starting point" for both virtual conventions that have a VR space and for artists that want to join in.  My hope is that this is something that is both easy to implement with no real need to learn anything new, but also have soemthing that could be customized by an experienced user into something cool.
The reason for making this into something that resembles a real life dealer's den booth is that it should be something that is approachable for any artist or dealer.  While going into something that can't exist IRL is a fine use of a virtual space, having a real life ref to work from might make it quicker for an artist to make something.
Virtual fur cons are going to be a thing for a little while longer, we might as well try to make it easier on everyone involved to participate
